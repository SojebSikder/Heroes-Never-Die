## Story:

**Rescue of the Realm**

<b>"The fate of the kingdom, the life of Princess Humayra, and the future of the world rest on Sojeb’s courage and the magic of Joynix.
"</b>

In the peaceful kingdom of Jimcity, Princess Humayra Siddika ruled with grace and kindness, loved by all, especially the brave warrior Sojeb Sikder. One day, Humayra gifted Sojeb a mystical bird named Joynix, with the power to heal him whenever he was near death. “This bird will protect you in your darkest moments,” she told him.

But peace was short-lived. The evil Skeleton King, long thought defeated, returned with his undead army and captured Princess Humayra, seeking to use her life force to plunge the world into darkness. Determined to save her, Sojeb set out on a dangerous journey, battling monsters and navigating treacherous lands. Each time death seemed near, Joynix’s magic would heal him, giving him the strength to carry on.

Now, as Sojeb stands before the Skeleton King’s fortress, he prepares for the final battle. With Joynix by his side, he must rescue Princess Humayra and save Jimcity from eternal doom.
